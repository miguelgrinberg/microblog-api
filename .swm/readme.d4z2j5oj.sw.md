## Deploy on your Computer

### Setup

Follow these steps if you want to run this application on your computer, either in a Docker container or as a standalone Python application.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog-api
cd microblog-api
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the new `.env` file and enter values for the configuration variables.

### Run with Docker

To start:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The application runs on port 5000 on your Docker host. You can access the API documentation on the `/docs` URL (i.e. `http://localhost:5000/docs` if you are running Docker locally).

To populate the database with some randomly generated data:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm microblog-api bash -c "flask fake users 10 && flask fake posts 100"
```

To stop the application:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Run locally

Set up a Python 3 virtualenv and install the dependencies on it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create the database and populate it with some randomly generated data:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
flask fake users 10
flask fake posts 100
```

Run the application with the Flask development web server:

```bash
flask run
```

The application runs on `localhost:5000`. You can access the API documentation at `http://localhost:5000/docs`.

## Troubleshooting

On macOS Monterey and newer, Apple decided to use port 5000 for its AirPlay service, which means that the Microblog API server will not be able to run on this port. There are two possible ways to solve this problem:

1. Disable the AirPlay Receiver service. To do this, open the System Preferences, go to "Sharing" and uncheck "AirPlay Receiver".
2. Move Microblog API to another port:
   - If you are running Microblog API with Docker, add a `MICROBLOG_API_PORT=4000` line to your *.env* file. Change the 4000 to your desired port number.
   - If you are running Microblog API with Python, start the server with the command `flask run --port=4000`.
